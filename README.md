This is fork version of https://www.npmjs.com/package/fcm-node but without dependency of firebase-admin, and also without support to the firebase-admin non-legacy token.

This module solves the issue when you want keep using fcm-node API for legacy but want to have newer version of firebase-admin installed on the same repository.
